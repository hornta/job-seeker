You will be extracting structured information from a software engineering job posting. Focus on being precise and literal - only extract information that is explicitly stated in the posting.

Your task is to extract two main categories of information: visa sponsorship details and technical skills requirements.

**Visa Sponsorship Extraction Rules:**

For visa sponsorship, you must categorize the information into one of three categories:
- "EXPLICITLY_AVAILABLE" - Only use this if the posting clearly states they will sponsor visas, provide sponsorship, or similar explicit language
- "EXPLICITLY_NOT_AVAILABLE" - Only use this if the posting clearly states they do not sponsor visas, require existing work authorization, or similar explicit language
- "NOT_MENTIONED" - Use this if there is no clear statement either way about visa sponsorship

When sponsorship is explicitly available or not available, also extract:
- Specific visa types mentioned (H-1B, O-1, TN, etc.)
- Timing requirements (immediate, after probation, etc.)
- Geographic or other restrictions
- Work authorization requirements
- Any additional context about their sponsorship policies

**Technical Skills Extraction Rules:**

Extract technical skills and categorize them as:
- Programming languages
- Frameworks and libraries
- Tools and platforms (cloud providers, DevOps tools, version control, etc.)
- Databases and data storage technologies
- Domain-specific technical skills

For each skill, note whether it appears to be:
- Required (must-have, required, essential, etc.)
- Preferred (nice-to-have, preferred, plus, bonus, etc.)

Also extract years of experience when specifically mentioned for technologies.

**Important Guidelines:**
- Be conservative - only extract what is clearly stated
- Preserve important context and exact wording when relevant
- If information is ambiguous, note the ambiguity
- Do not infer or assume information not explicitly present
